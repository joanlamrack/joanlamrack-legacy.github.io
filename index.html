					<h5>My Initial Blog</h5>
					<span>18 May 2018</span>
					<p>
						Hey there, reader! yes, you. Thanks for visiting this blog site :) . While nothing special (yet) posted in this
						site, I'll try to share everything I know about as being the learning Fullstack Javascript Developer @Hacktiv8.
						It's still first week at Phase 0, but hopefully I will be able to update it as I progressing with the Learning,
						all the way to Phase 3.
					</p>
					<p>
						Wish me Luck!

					<h5>Ok, What is Hacktiv8? Why did you join?</h5>
					<span>18 May 2018</span>
					<div class="centeredimage"><img src="assets/Logo-Hacktiv8-bordered.png"></div>
					<p>
						Hacktiv8 is a bootcamp that will teach and guide you through the process of becoming (of course) a programmer.
						No, hold on that initial thought that you will hear a lengthy lecture on a class with air-conditioner(s) that
						made it felt like time to sleep.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the contrary, the lecture is barebone and direct. What you will most of the time do is programming the task,
						exploring the materials and IDE, or discussing with peers/lecturer.
					</p>
					<p>
						That's a bit of Hacktiv8. Now, Why did I join Hacktiv8?
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite my hesitation for it's price and my own background that <u>seems</u> solid for a programmer (I studied
						Computer Engineering and worked as IT for 6 months), I do not feel that the programs I made is really effective
						nor it has some goal. One of the reasons this thoughts came; I watched Linux creator's Interview that analyze and
						separate "Good Taste" and "Bad Taste" Code. See for yourself the interview below;
					</p>
					<div class="youtube_embed">
						<video controls>
							<source src="assets/The mind behind Linux _ Linus Torvalds_360p.mp4" type="video/mp4">
							Your browser doesn't support video
							<!--This is for users with no html5 video support -->
						</video>

					</div>

					<p>
						That interview made me realize what I'm missing at the first place as a programmer. Logic, problem solving,
						defining goal and dissecting each steps to a smaller problem. Hence, I joined the bootcamp, putting myself in the
						shoes of non-IT people. Because no matter what your background is, what programmers do is programming something
						that will make ( yours and ) other people's life easier.
					</p>

					<p>
						That's the reason why I joined Hacktiv8.

					<h5>The Boss is Here : Final Live Code Phase 0</h5>
					<span>4 July 2018</span>
					<p>
						Preparation to be made. We already got the simulation quizzes from our instructors, and I did my research to get
						extra quizzes to make time trial. My goal, to solve the Live Code as quick and right as possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						But unexpected things happens. Somehow the instructions and the description of the problem sometimes didn't
						match, and numeral of times we are interupted by the corrections. I even almost wrongly answered one problem with
						another T-T But overall, I feel that I'm doing my very best at the time.
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyway, I'm sharing <a class="links" href="https://github.com/joanlamrack/Uberfox-Hacktiv8-Phase0" target="blank">my
							phase 0 repo<a>. hopefully it would be useful for you who are in the Phase 0 as well.

					<h5>Making friendemy with DOM : Tic Tac Toe Project</h5>
					<span>8 July 2018</span>


					<p>
						While playing with DOM, I realize some interesting things:
					</p>

					<li>
						<ul>
							That all things we see in browser is actually is what browser render from a bunch of scripts, starting from
							html, css and javascript....
						</ul>
						<ul>
							...Which make the reason why each browser would have slightly different look even opening same site.
						</ul>
						<ul>
							DOM is generated when browser parsed the HTML file. But DOM <u>also</u> can be created from the javascript.
						</ul>
						<ul>
							It is advised to have food delivery subscription. Most of the resto are far, so you'll find yourself walking
							10-20 minutes before you have a good meal.
						</ul>
						<ul>
							Invest in Noise cancelling Headphones. You need to be in Zen mode to give your best.
						</ul>
					</li>

						Above is the final stuff for my final project. Made using pure dom manipulation with javascript. Pretty cool huh?

					<h5>I Passed Phase 0! Now What?</h5>

					<p>
						After finishing some administrations and having fun in the weekend before the storm, I finally arrived again
						@Hacktiv8 for the next Phase. The real challenges now begins. First we were briefed, signed some papers, and
						photoshoot (for professional looking in CV and such), then off we go to the Phase 1.
					</p>
					<p>
						Everyday we are given challenges to be done on the same day, lectures, live codes are to be done in the faster
						pace. I'm really overwhelmed by this. <b>Everything is different but show must go on</b>. I decided to come early
						so I can jumpstart the challenges, come home a little bit late to work on assignments. But that came at a cost.
						I'm not feeling well afterwards, so is few others. Some even go home after our first Phase Live Code.
					</p>
					<p>
						All I see in the lab are either pale, sick, thinking hard, gave out or stressed out faces. This means both good
						and bad... in a way.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some advice for Phase 1 (May change over weeks):
					</p>

					<li>
						<ul>
							It's much better joining Hacktiv8 at Phase 0. Because you will be introducted to the learning pace of Hacktiv8
							at much managable pace, so you know what to expect of Live codes, and projects.
						</ul>
						<ul>
							More or less; the Live Code for phase 1 is structured a lot different. there are difficulty stages for each
							problem (Easy, Medium, Hard), and we are given two hours to solve it. Still, I'm not prepared.
						</ul>
						<ul>
							Less time for "Me" Time <-- Totally agreed. Even weekends is filled with challenges. </ul> <ul>
								It is advised to have food delivery subscription. Most of the resto are far, so you'll find yourself walking
								10-20 minutes before you have a good meal.
						</ul>
						<ul>
							Invest in Noise cancelling Headphones. You need to be in Zen mode to give your best.
						</ul>
					</li>

					<p>
						As for now, I'm preparing for the next week. Wish me luck!
