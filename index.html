					<h5>My Initial Blog</h5>
					<span>18 May 2018</span>
					<p>
						Hey there, reader! yes, you. Thanks for visiting this blog site :) . While nothing special (yet) posted in this site, I'll try to share everything I know about as being the learning Fullstack Javascript Developer @Hacktiv8. It's still first week at Phase 0, but hopefully I will be able to update it as I progressing with the Learning, all the way to Phase 3.
					</p>
					<p>
						Wish me Luck!

					<h5>Ok, What is Hacktiv8? Why did you join?</h5>
					<span>18 May 2018</span>
					<div class="centeredimage"><img src="assets/Logo-Hacktiv8-bordered.png"></div>
					<p>
						Hacktiv8 is a bootcamp that will teach and guide you through the process of becoming (of course) a programmer. No, hold on that initial thought that you will hear a lengthy lecture on a class with air-conditioner(s) that made it felt like time to sleep.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the contrary, the lecture is barebone and direct. What you will most of the time do is programming the task, exploring the materials and IDE, or discussing with peers/lecturer.
					</p>
					<p>
						That's a bit of Hacktiv8. Now, Why did I join Hacktiv8?
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite my hesitation for it's price and my own background that <u>seems</u> solid for a programmer (I studied Computer Engineering and worked as IT for 6 months), I do not feel that the programs I made is really effective nor it has some goal. One of the reasons this thoughts came; I watched Linux creator's Interview that analyze and separate "Good Taste" and "Bad Taste" Code. See for yourself the interview below;
					</p>
					<div class="youtube_embed">
						<video controls>
						    <source src="assets/The mind behind Linux _ Linus Torvalds_360p.mp4" type="video/mp4">
						    Your browser doesn't support video <!--This is for users with no html5 video support --->
						</video>

					</div>

					<p>
						That interview made me realize what I'm missing at the first place as a programmer. Logic, problem solving, defining goal and dissecting each steps to a smaller problem. Hence, I joined the bootcamp, putting myself in the shoes of non-IT people. Because no matter what your background is, what programmers do is programming something that will make ( yours and ) other people's life easier.
					</p>

					<p>
						That's the reason why I joined Hacktiv8.
